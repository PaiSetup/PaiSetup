    Association of extensions with applications and other shell features are all stored in registry.
    There seems to be no easy way to alter them via API calls, so the registry has to be manually
    fiddled with. Below are some notes about how it all works.

    HKCU\SOFTWARE\Classes and HKLM\SOFTWARE\Classes contains the most important data about extensions.
    There is a separate subkey for each extension, although metadata does not lie directly in this
    key. Instead, its default value is a name of another key, which is also in
    HKCU\SOFTWARE\Classes and contains app-specific information (e.g. icon, command to open the file,
    description of the application, etc.). So the value in HKLM\SOFTWARE\Classes\<extension> could be
    treated as a pointer to the app-specific key. Not sure how it's actually called, but let's call it
    application key. This mechanism is probably made to allow reusing app-specific data for multiple
    extensions.

    HKCR is a merged view of HKCU\SOFTWARE\Classes and HKLM\SOFTWARE\Classes. It can contain keys
    and values from both of them (HKCU is more important). This is created mainly for compatibility
    reasons and we shouldn't set values to HKCR, but rather HKLM or HKCU directly. When removing
    values, they should be removed from both HKLM and HKCU to be sure they are gone.

    HKCU\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts (or HKLM counterpart) contains
    additional information about extension associations. There is a separate subkey for each extension.
